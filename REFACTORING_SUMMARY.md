# Project-Sentinel Refactoring Summary

## âœ… Successfully Completed Refactoring

### Phase 1: Simplified Project Structure
- **Deleted** `src/sentinel/api/v1/analytics.py`
- **Deleted** `src/sentinel/api/v1/threats.py`
- **Emptied** `src/sentinel/core/models.py` (file kept but content removed)
- **Deleted** `src/sentinel/middleware/` directory and all contents
- **Deleted** `src/sentinel/services/elasticsearch_service.py`

### Phase 2: Implemented Core Data Processing Logic
- **Replaced** `src/sentinel/main.py` with new startup code that creates a background task on application startup
- **Replaced** `src/sentinel/services/threat_processor.py` with new functional processing logic that:
  - Continuously polls Elasticsearch for new honeypot events
  - Processes and cleans the data
  - Stores processed events in a dedicated index
  - Marks events as processed to avoid duplication

### Phase 3: Implemented Single Useful API Endpoint
- **Replaced** `src/sentinel/api/v1/endpoints.py` with new endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/health` - Simple health check
  - `/api/v1/events/latest` - Returns latest processed honeypot events

### Phase 4: Final Configuration Cleanup
- **Replaced** `requirements.txt` with minimal dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `elasticsearch`
- **Replaced** `infra/honeypot/cowrie.cfg` with minimal JSON logging configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ New Architecture Overview

The refactored system now provides:
1. **Background Processing**: Automatic processing of honeypot logs via background task
2. **Clean Data Pipeline**: Raw logs â†’ Processed events â†’ Clean Elasticsearch index
3. **Simple API**: Two essential endpoints for health monitoring and data retrieval
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only 3 core dependencies for simplicity

## ðŸš€ Ready to Run

The system is now a lean, functional proof-of-concept that:
- Processes honeypot data in real-time
- Provides clean, accessible threat intelligence via API
- Can be easily extended with additional features
- Has minimal complexity and dependencies
